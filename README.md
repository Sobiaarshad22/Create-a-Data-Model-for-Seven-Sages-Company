# Create-a-Data-Model and PowerBI Report -for-Seven-Sages-Company
In this project, I created a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company that combines information from all over the company
The data model created in this project made it possible for the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze what product sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.
Combined and centralize data that was previously soiled, solving a very common issue facing many companies.
More importantly, requirements for more complex reporting visualization demands, advanced DAX requirements, or larger data models.
